# Monkeyble

Monkeyble is a callback plugin for Ansible that allow to execute end-to-end tests on Ansible playbooks with a 
Pythonic testing approach. 🧐

Monkeyble allows, at task level, to:

- 🐵 Check that a module has been called with expected argument values
- 🙊 Check that a module returned the expected result dictionary
- 🙈 Check the task state (changed, skipped, failed)
- 🙉 Mock a module and return a defined dictionary as result

Monkeyble is designed to be executed by a CI/CD in order to detect regressions when updating an Ansible code base. 🚀 

## Quick tour

Complete documentation available [here](https://hewlettpackard.github.io/monkeyble).

Ansible resources are models of desired-state. Ansible modules have their own unit tests and guarantee you of their correct functioning.
As such, it's not necessary to test that services are started, packages are installed, or other such things. 
Ansible is the system that will ensure these things are declaratively true.

That being said, an Ansible playbook is commonly a bunch of data manipulation before calling a module that will perform a particular action.
For example, we get data from an API endpoint, or from the result of a module, we register a variable, then use a filter transform the data like combining two dictionary, 
transforming into a list, changing the type, extract a specific value, etc... to finally call another module in a new task with the transformed data..

Given a defined list of variable as input we want to be sure that a particular task: 

- is well called with the expected instantiated arguments
- produced this exact result
- has been skipped, changed or has failed

### Check input

Monkeyble allows to check each instantiated argument value when the task is called:

```yml
  - task: "my_task_name"
    test_input:
      - assert_equal:
          arg_name: module_argument
          expected: "my_value"
```

Monkeyble support multiple test methods:

- assert_equal
- assert_not_equal
- assert_in
- assert_not_in
- assert_true
- assert_false
- assert_is_none
- assert_is_not_none
- assert_list_equal
- assert_dict_equal

### Check output

Monkeyble allows to check the output result dictionary of a task

```yml
  - task: "my_task_name"
    test_output:
      - assert_dict_equal:
          dict_key: "result.key.name"
          expected: 
            key1: "my_value"
            key2: "my_other_value"
```

Same methods as the `test_input` are supported.

### Task states

Monkeyble allow to check the states of a task

```yml
  - task: "my_task_name"
    should_be_skipped: false
    should_be_changed: true
    should_failed: false
```

### Cli 

Monkeyble comes with a CLI that allow to execute all tests from a single command and return a summary of test executions.
```bash
monkeyble test

Playbook   | Scenario        | Test passed
-----------+-----------------+-------------
 play1.yml | validate_test_1 | ✅
 play1.yml | validate_test_2 | ✅
 play2.yml | validate_this   | ✅
 play2.yml | validate_that   | ✅
 
 🐵 Monkeyble test result - Tests passed: 4 of 4 tests
```

### Monkey patching

Monkey patching is a technique that allows you to intercept what a function would normally do, substituting its full execution with a return value of your own specification. 
In the case of Ansible, the function is actually a module and the returned value is the "result" dictionary.

Consider a scenario where you are working with public cloud API or infrastructure module. 
In the context of testing, you do not want to create a real instance of an object in the cloud like a VM or a container orchestrator.
But you still need eventually the returned dictionary so the playbook can be executed entirely.

Monkeyble allows to mock a task and return a specific value:
```yml
- task: "my_task_name"
  mock:
    config:
      monkeyble_module:
        consider_changed: true
        result_dict:
          my_key: "mock value"
```

## Do I need Monkeyble?

The common testing strategy when using Ansible is to deploy to a staging environment that simulates the production.
When a role or a playbook is updated, we usually run an integration test battery against staging again before pushing in production.

But when our playbooks are exposed in an [Ansible Controller/AWX](https://www.ansible.com/products/controller) (ex Tower)
or available as a service in a catalog like [Squest](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/squest), we need to be sure that we don't have any regressions 
when updating the code base, especially when modifying a role used by multiple playbooks. This is where Monkeyble is helpful. Placed in a CI/CD it will 
be in charge of validating that the legacy code is always working as expected.

Monkeyble is a tool that can help you to enhance the quality of your Ansible code base and can be coupled 
with [official best practices](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/test_strategies.html).
